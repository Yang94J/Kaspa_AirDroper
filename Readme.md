To install the dependency for the project , just use:

`npm install`

To run the quick airdrop, type

`node index.js <File> <Amount> <PayBackAddress>`

For example
`node index.js airdrop-demo.txt 0.001 kaspa:qr8vd90up3hffcjn9wtkkdnm4r6awv004yuqtxq9y8lpec462fvnq64erg4nq`

File is the list of kaspa address, Amount is the number of kaspa, PayBackAddress is for gas fee pay back.

`Test Purpose only ... Be careful with use`.
